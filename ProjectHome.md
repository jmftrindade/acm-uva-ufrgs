From Wikipedia:

"ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (abbreviated as ACM-ICPC or just ICPC) is an annual multi-tiered competition among the universities of the world". In this context, the ACM University of Valladolid (UVa) online judge is a website containing a set of publicly available problems targeted at the ACM ICPC.

The acm-uva-ufrgs project is a central repository with solutions for problems from the ACM UVa online judge. These solutions are implemented and maintained by students from the Informatics Institute at Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), Brazil.
